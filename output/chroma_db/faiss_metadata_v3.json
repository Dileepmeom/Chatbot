Design and operation is simple and understandable. Any maintenance required can be handled by Municipal operating personnel - including - eventual seat replacement and the valve need not be removed from the line.\n\nAPCO CAC-8000 Automatic Control Check Valves are more efficient than valves of conventional design because of their multi-purpose functions. As a result, system design is simplified. Also, the full flow Globe body compensates for the area occupied by the disc, greatly minimizing the head loss thru the flow section of the valve.\n\nAPCO CAC-8000 Automatic Control Check Valves save power costs due to the smooth flow area and valuable space in the Pump House due to their multi-purpose functions.",

This Slip Gear feature allows the valve to operate as a check valve within this gap. Operating as a check valve, the dashpot cylinder system fully controls disc movement during either the opening or closing cycle. The dashpot cylinder system has 3 control stages:\n\n1.

The lower half shows various control positions (actual position of wormwheel). The two pointers move independently of each other. The longer arrow points to the disc position, is directly connected to the shaft. The shorter arrow is mounted on the wormwheel, which rotates freely on the shaft. See Figure 8.\n\nReferring to the control position indicator (lower half), the distance from 'check' to 'C' is the power close travel, meaning the valve will control flow in the normal direction, but has the ability to freely close, if there is a reversal flow. The distance from 'check' to 'O' is the power open travel, meaning the wormwheel will force the disc to open, thereby controlling flow in the reverse direction.\n\n<!-- PAGE 13 END -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- PAGE 14 END -->",

In Figure 10: As the Cushion Plunger (1) enters cushion cavity (2) the exhaust fluid is almost completely trapped by the Ball Check (3) and the Adjusting Screw (4), creating a back pressure against Piston Assembly. The back pressure cushions and slows the final part of the piston stroke, thus, reducing the high impact hammering of the Piston Assembly against the cylinder cap. Turning the Adjusting Screw (4) to allow more or less fluid to escape regulates the degree of cushioning as desired.\n\nIn Figure 11: When pressurized fluid enters the Cylinder Cap End to stroke the Piston Assembly in the opposite direction, the pressure fluid moves the ball check (3) off its seat, opening the passage for more fluid to act against the piston, thus speeding its start-up movement as the Cushion Plunger (1) is immediately forced out of its cavity (2).\n\n<!-- PAGE 15 END -->",

The load's normal power source is backed up by a secondary (emergency) power source. A transfer switch is connected to both the normal and emergency sources and supplies the load with power from one of these two sources. In the event that power is lost from the normal source, the transfer switch transfers the load to the secondary source. Transfer can be automatic or manual, depending upon the type of transfer switch equipment being used. Once normal power is restored, the load is transferred back to the normal power source.\n\nIn automatic transfer switch equipment, the switch's intelligence system initiates the transfer when normal power fails or falls below a preset voltage. If the emergency source is a standby generator, the transfer switch initiates generator starting and transfers to the emergency source when sufficient generator voltage is available. When normal power is restored, the transfer switch automatically transfers back and initiates engine shutdown.\n\nAn automatic transfer switch consists of three basic elements:\n\n1. Main contacts to connect and disconnect the load to and from the source of power\n2. A transfer mechanism to affect the transfer of the main contacts from source to source\n3. Intelligence/supervisory circuits to constantly monitor the condition of the power sources and thus provide the intelligence necessary for the switch and related circuit operation\n\nThis manual deals with the third basic element of the automatic transfer switch, the required intelligence/ supervisory circuits. Prior to the introduction of ATC-600, this function was performed by a door mounted logic panel. The logic panel could be the relay logic type or the solid state logic type. In either case, the panel consisted of a number of individually mounted and wired devices offering a limited amount of system flexibility, especially in the case of the relay logic design. ATC-600 brings intelligence, supervisory and programming capabilities, never before available, to automatic transfer switch equipment.",

The logic panel could be the relay logic type or the solid state logic type. In either case, the panel consisted of a number of individually mounted and wired devices offering a limited amount of system flexibility, especially in the case of the relay logic design. ATC-600 brings intelligence, supervisory and programming capabilities, never before available, to automatic transfer switch equipment.]\n\n## 1.3 Product Overview\n\nThe ATC-600 is a comprehensive, multi-function, microprocessor based automatic transfer switch controller. It is a compact, selfcontained, panel mounted device designed to replace traditional relay and solid state logic panels (Figures 1 and 2 ).\n\nDesigned to meet the needs of markets worldwide, ATC-600:\n\n- Is a UL Recognized Component\n- Meets Seismic Requirements of Uniform and California Building Codes (exceeding requirements of worst case Zone 4 levels)\n- Complies with UL 991 environmental tests\n- Complies with IEC 61000-4-2, 61000-4-3, 61000-4-4, and 61000-4-5\n- Complies with CISPR 11, Class A\n- Complies with FCC Part 15, Subpart B, Class A\n\nATC-600 provides an unmatched degree of programmed flexibility to address the needs of any system. It operates from most system voltages available worldwide at 50 or 60 Hertz. In addition, a period of no control power operation is provided. ATC-600 monitors the condition of the 3-phase line-to-line voltage and frequency of both the Normal and Emergency sources. It can also be programmed for single phase operation. ATC-600 provides the necessary intelligence to insure that the switch operates properly through a series of programmed sensing and timing functions.\n\nA standard ATC-600 will:\n\n- Monitor Normal and Emergency source voltages and frequencies\n- Provide undervoltage monitoring of Normal and Emergency sources\n- Permit customer programming\n- Display real time and historical information\n- Permit system testing\n- Offer Help Screen assistance\n- Store customer/factory established parameters in nonvolatile memory\n- Communicate using a PONI\n- Provide faceplate source/load status indications\n\nA wide array of additional features are available to address the most sophisticated system requirements, such as:\n\n- Previously unavailable Load Monitoring and Delayed Transition\n- In-phase Transition",

ATC-600 provides the functionality of numerous other devices combined in one package that mounts in less than 7 by 11 inches of panel space.\n\nThe user friendly front panel interface simplifies routine operation, programming, data presentation and setting adjustments. An LED based display provides the flexibility of large character displays for enhanced visibility. The operation of front panel membrane pushbuttons moves the ATC-600 display from function to function or step to step within a function. Three LEDs at the top of the faceplate provide an immediate indication as to the device's operational mode. An integral Help Mode provides immediate user assistance in the form of English language message displays through the use of a front panel Help pushbutton.\n\nWith a P roduct O perated N etwork I nterface (PONI), the ATC-600 is communications ready and compatible with other devices in the IQ Family of products. The Communication Module (PONI) is available in three versions, the INCOM PONI, RS-232 PONI and PONI Modem. Reliable two-way communications can be provided over a twisted pair communications network.

Communications is made possible by mounting a small, addressable communication module (PONI) to the back of the ATC-600 (Figure 3 ) or in a remote location. Since the ATC600 is always supplied with a communications port, a PONI can be easily retrofitted to the ATC-600 at any time. It is recommended that the control power to the ATC-600 be removed prior to connecting or disconnecting a PONI. When using the INCOM PONI on the ATC-600, the PONI function switches should be set to either of the Standard PONI modes (PONI 9600 Baud or PONI 1200 Baud).

It provides a summary of ATC-600's intelligence and supervisory circuits which constantly monitor the condition of both normal and emergency power sources thus providing the required intelligence for transfer operations. These circuits, for example, automatically initiate an immediate transfer of power when power fails or voltage levels drop below a preset value. Exactly what ATC-600 will initiate in response to a given system condition depends upon the combination of standard and selected optional features. Refer to Paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 for ATC-600's standard and optional features.\n\nWhen the preferred source is connected and the automatic transfer switch is operating normally, the Automatic LED blinks green and no message appears in the display window. In the event of a power failure, the display automatically becomes active showing the status of timers relative to an alternate source transfer. Once the alternate source becomes available, the transfer is made consistent with pre-programmed features. In a similar manner, transfer back to the preferred source is made once the preferred source is again available.

After this relay responds, the ATC-600 will start the Time Delay Sequence timer (TSEQ).

If a test is desired, the Engine Test Pushbutton must be pressed a second time before the 2 1/2 minutes have expired. At this time the Status and Test Mode LEDs are lit red, and one Test Mode cycle is implemented.\n\nThe exact test conditions are determined by programmed setpoints.

Refer to Section 5 Programming and specifically Table 2 for test programming details.\n\nA load transfer test cycle includes a full generator start, a transfer, and a re-transfer. For the test cycle to proceed, the Normal Source must be available. The test cycle will be aborted if the Emergency Source does not become available within a set time-out period, or if a needed source becomes unavailable. In addition, the test will be aborted if the Test Pushbutton is again pressed and released. Both LEDs turn off upon the successful completion of a test cycle, once the time delay engine cool down timer has expired and the generator is stopped.\n\nIf the 'Number of Generators' setpoint is programmed to zero, the Engine Test Pushbutton is not functional. If the setpoint is programmed to two, the test will be performed on the generator not connected to the load.\n\nWhen an engine test is in progress, it may be aborted the following ways:\n\n1.

As such, it can be remotely monitored, controlled and programmed when equipped with the communications option. The ATC-600 is supplied with a communications port as standard. This permits it to have the communications option supplied from the factory or retrofitted at a later date. The communications option is achieved by mounting a small, addressable communications module, the PONI, to the back of the ATC-600 (Paragraph 2.4 and Figure 3 ).\n\nIMPACC is a noise immune communications system that permits communications from the ATC-600 to a master computer via a high frequency carrier signal over a shielded twisted pair of conductors. The shielded twisted pair of conductors can extend up to 7500 feet without the use of repeaters. Communications between IMPACC compatible devices, such as ATC-600 and the master computer is made possible by the INCOM (Industrial Communications) chip, which accounts for the system's high degree of reliability.",

The same anticipatory scheme used for closed transition is also used for in-phase transition. The advance angle is calculated based on the frequency difference between the two sources and also the response time of the breaker. This results in the optimum reconnect angle of 0 degrees for all of the frequency difference values.\n\nThe criteria for in-phase transition are similar to closed transition. Both sources must be available and the frequency difference must be less than the in-phase transition frequency difference setpoint (0.0 to 3.0 Hz). When these conditions are met, the ATC-600 will monitor the phase difference between the two sources. The synchronization timer will count down and be displayed as 'TSIP' while waiting for synchronization to be detected. When the phase difference is within the advance angle window, the 'transfer' command is given. This is an open transition but both sources will be in phase when the transfer occurs.\n\nIf the synchronization does not occur within a specified amount of time, the transfer will take place under delayed transition.The Alarm relay will energize and the failure will be logged into the Transfer History as either 'Sync Fail - Freq' or 'Sync Fail - Phase' depending on whether the frequency difference or the phase difference was excessive.\n\nEffective: March 2010",

If the switch is not located in view from the ATC-600, lock it out to guard against other personnel accidentally turning it on.\n- Step 2: Verify that all 'foreign' power sources wired to the ATC600 are de-energized. These may also be present on some of the terminal blocks.\n- Step 3: Before disconnecting any wires from the unit, make sure they are individually identified to assure that reconnection can be correctly performed. Make a sketch to help with the task of terminal and wire identification.\n- Step 4: Remove all wires and disconnect plug-type connectors.",

Observe strict cleanliness.\n5. Bear in mind the risk of electrical accidents.\n6. 6 Make sure that the lifting equipment is in good condition.\n7. Provide a suitable barrier around the work area, for example a guard rail.\n8. Make sure that you have a clear path of retreat!\n9. Use a safety helmet, safety goggles and protective shoes/gloves.\n10. All personnel who work with sewage systems should be vaccinated against diseases that can occur.\n11.

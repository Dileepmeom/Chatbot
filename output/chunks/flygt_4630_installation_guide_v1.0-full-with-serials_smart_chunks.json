Never work alone. Use a lifting harness (part No. 84 33 02), a safety line (part No. 84 33 03) and a respirator (part No. 84 33 01), as required. Do not ignore the risk of drowning!\n2.

Observe strict cleanliness.\n5. Bear in mind the risk of electrical accidents.\n6. 6 Make sure that the lifting equipment is in good condition.\n7. Provide a suitable barrier around the work area, for example a guard rail.\n8. Make sure that you have a clear path of retreat!\n9. Use a safety helmet, safety goggles and protective shoes/gloves.\n10. All personnel who work with sewage systems should be vaccinated against diseases that can occur.\n11.

A check of the condition of the oil can show whether there has been an increased leakage. Check the oil by removing the oil drainage screw.

The load's normal power source is backed up by a secondary (emergency) power source. A transfer switch is connected to both the normal and emergency sources and supplies the load with power from one of these two sources. In the event that power is lost from the normal source, the transfer switch transfers the load to the secondary source. Transfer can be automatic or manual, depending upon the type of transfer switch equipment being used. Once normal power is restored, the load is transferred back to the normal power source.\n\nIn automatic transfer switch equipment, the switch's intelligence system initiates the transfer when normal power fails or falls below a preset voltage. If the emergency source is a standby generator, the transfer switch initiates generator starting and transfers to the emergency source when sufficient generator voltage is available. When normal power is restored, the transfer switch automatically transfers back and initiates engine shutdown.\n\nAn automatic transfer switch consists of three basic elements:\n\n1. Main contacts to connect and disconnect the load to and from the source of power\n2. A transfer mechanism to affect the transfer of the main contacts from source to source\n3. Intelligence/supervisory circuits to constantly monitor the condition of the power sources and thus provide the intelligence necessary for the switch and related circuit operation\n\nThis manual deals with the third basic element of the automatic transfer switch, the required intelligence/ supervisory circuits. Prior to the introduction of ATC-600, this function was performed by a door mounted logic panel. The logic panel could be the relay logic type or the solid state logic type. In either case, the panel consisted of a number of individually mounted and wired devices offering a limited amount of system flexibility, especially in the case of the relay logic design. ATC-600 brings intelligence, supervisory and programming capabilities, never before available, to automatic transfer switch equipment.",

ATC-600 features proprietary microprocessor technology to provide and maintain superior precision and versatility during both programming and data access.]\n\n## 1.4.1 Operational Simplicity\n\nFrom installation to programming to usage, ATC-600 was designed with operational simplicity in mind. Only one style needs to be considered, regardless of input/output requirements or system voltages and frequencies. ATC-600 provides the functionality of numerous other devices combined in one package that mounts in less than 7 by 11 inches of panel space.\n\nThe user friendly front panel interface simplifies routine operation, programming, data presentation and setting adjustments. An LED based display provides the flexibility of large character displays for enhanced visibility.

Communications is made possible by mounting a small, addressable communication module (PONI) to the back of the ATC-600 (Figure 3 ) or in a remote location. Since the ATC600 is always supplied with a communications port, a PONI can be easily retrofitted to the ATC-600 at any time. It is recommended that the control power to the ATC-600 be removed prior to connecting or disconnecting a PONI. When using the INCOM PONI on the ATC-600, the PONI function switches should be set to either of the Standard PONI modes (PONI 9600 Baud or PONI 1200 Baud).

It provides a summary of ATC-600's intelligence and supervisory circuits which constantly monitor the condition of both normal and emergency power sources thus providing the required intelligence for transfer operations. These circuits, for example, automatically initiate an immediate transfer of power when power fails or voltage levels drop below a preset value. Exactly what ATC-600 will initiate in response to a given system condition depends upon the combination of standard and selected optional features. Refer to Paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 for ATC-600's standard and optional features.\n\nWhen the preferred source is connected and the automatic transfer switch is operating normally, the Automatic LED blinks green and no message appears in the display window. In the event of a power failure, the display automatically becomes active showing the status of timers relative to an alternate source transfer. Once the alternate source becomes available, the transfer is made consistent with pre-programmed features. In a similar manner, transfer back to the preferred source is made once the preferred source is again available. System conditions relative to the sources and the load are clearly indicated by the LED type mimic bus.",

For contactor type transfer switch (2-position or 3-position), as soon as the time delay normal to emergency (or time delay emergency to normal) times out, all 10 of the sequence relays are sent open commands. The ATC-600 will make several attempts to communicate with a relay. If an address or relay is not used or if a relay fails to respond, the ATC-600 will move on to the next relay. Once the attempt to turn all the relays off has been made, the ATC-600 will start to sequence the 10 relays on. Starting with address 002, the ATC-600 will send the relay the command to close. After this relay responds, the ATC-600 will start the Time Delay Sequence timer (TSEQ). When this timer has counted down to zero, the ATC-600 will increment to the next address of 003 and send it the close command.

At this time the Status and Test Mode LEDs are lit red, and one Test Mode cycle is implemented.\n\nThe exact test conditions are determined by programmed setpoints.

For the test cycle to proceed, the Normal Source must be available. The test cycle will be aborted if the Emergency Source does not become available within a set time-out period, or if a needed source becomes unavailable. In addition, the test will be aborted if the Test Pushbutton is again pressed and released.

As such, it can be remotely monitored, controlled and programmed when equipped with the communications option. The ATC-600 is supplied with a communications port as standard. This permits it to have the communications option supplied from the factory or retrofitted at a later date. The communications option is achieved by mounting a small, addressable communications module, the PONI, to the back of the ATC-600 (Paragraph 2.4 and Figure 3 ).\n\nIMPACC is a noise immune communications system that permits communications from the ATC-600 to a master computer via a high frequency carrier signal over a shielded twisted pair of conductors. The shielded twisted pair of conductors can extend up to 7500 feet without the use of repeaters. Communications between IMPACC compatible devices, such as ATC-600 and the master computer is made possible by the INCOM (Industrial Communications) chip, which accounts for the system's high degree of reliability.",

The same anticipatory scheme used for closed transition is also used for in-phase transition. The advance angle is calculated based on the frequency difference between the two sources and also the response time of the breaker. This results in the optimum reconnect angle of 0 degrees for all of the frequency difference values.\n\nThe criteria for in-phase transition are similar to closed transition. Both sources must be available and the frequency difference must be less than the in-phase transition frequency difference setpoint (0.0 to 3.0 Hz). When these conditions are met, the ATC-600 will monitor the phase difference between the two sources. The synchronization timer will count down and be displayed as 'TSIP' while waiting for synchronization to be detected. When the phase difference is within the advance angle window, the 'transfer' command is given. This is an open transition but both sources will be in phase when the transfer occurs.\n\nIf the synchronization does not occur within a specified amount of time, the transfer will take place under delayed transition.The Alarm relay will energize and the failure will be logged into the Transfer History as either 'Sync Fail - Freq' or 'Sync Fail - Phase' depending on whether the frequency difference or the phase difference was excessive.\n\nEffective: March 2010",

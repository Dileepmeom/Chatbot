<!-- image -->

## GENERAL DESIGN OF A FLYGT PUMP

The motor can be started by direct on-line or stardelta starting.

The motor can be run continuously or intermittently with a maximum of 15 evenly spaced starts per hour.

Flygt motors are tested in accordance with IEC 34-1.

The stator is insulated in accordance with class H (180°C, 360°F). The motor is designed to deliver its rated output at - 5% variation from the rated voltage. Without overheating the motor, - 10% variation from the rated voltage can be accepted provided that the motor does not run continuously at full load. The motor is designed to operate at a voltage imbalance of up to 2% between the phases.

## Monitoring  equipment

The stator incorporates thermal contacts connected in series.

The pump can be equipped with sensors for sensing water in the oil* and/or stator housing.

*Not applicable to Ex-approved pumps.

<!-- PAGE 5 END -->

## Handling equipment

Lifting equipment is required for handling the pump.

<!-- image -->

- Stay clear of suspended loads.
- Always lift the pump by its lifting handle - never by the motor cable or the hose.

The minimum height between the lifting hook and the floor shall be sufficient to lift the pump out of the sump.

The lifting equipment shall be able to hoist the pump straight up and down in the sump, preferably without the need for resetting the lifting hook.

Oversize lifting equipment could cause damage if the pump should stick when being lifted.

Make sure that the lifting equipment is securely anchored.

## General recommendations

To ensure proper installation, please see the dimensions on the dimensional drawing in the Parts List.

NOTE! The end of the cable must not be submerged. It must be above flood level, as water may penetrate through the cable into the junction box or the motor.

Check that the lifting handle and chain are in good condition.

For automatic operation of the pump (level control), it is recommended that the level regulators be used at low voltage. The data sheet delivered with the regulators gives the permissible voltage. Local rules may specify otherwise.

Clean out all debris from the sump before the pump is lowered down and the station is started.

<!-- image -->

Special rules apply to installation in explosive atmosphere.

- Intrinsically safe circuits are normally required (Ex i) for the automatic level control system by level regulators.
- Minimum stop level should be according to the dimensional drawing.
- The pump must never run dry.

## INSTALLATION

## Safety precautions

In order to minimize the risk of accidents in connection with the service and installation work, the following rules should be followed:

11. Never work alone. Use a lifting harness, safety line and a respirator as required. Do not ignore the risk of drowning!
12. Make sure there are no poisonous gases within the work area.
13. Check the explosion risk before welding or using electric hand tools.
14. Do not ignore health hazards. Observe strict cleanliness.
15. Bear in mind the risk of electrical accidents.
16. Make sure that the lifting equipment is in good condition.
17. Provide a suitable barrier around the work area, e.g a guard rail.
18. Make sure you have a clear path of retreat!
19. Use safety helmet, safety goggles and protective shoes.
10. All personnel who work with sewage systems must be vaccinated against diseases to which they may be exposed.
11. A first-aid kit must be close at hand.
12. Note that special rules apply to installation in explosive athmosphere.

Follow all other health and safety rules and local codes and ordinances.

## ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

- Before starting work on the pump, make sure that the pump and the control panel are isolated from the power supply and cannot be energized.
- If the pump is equipped with automatic level control, there is a risk of sudden restart.
- All electrical equipment must be earthed. This applies to both pump equipment and any monitoring  equipment.

Failure to heed this warning may cause a lethal accident. Make sure that the earth lead is correctly connected by testing it.

## NOTE for Ex version

- Electrical connections on the explosion-proof motor must be made by authorized personnel.

Flygt disclaims all responsibility for work done by untrained, unauthorized personnel.

- The pump may be used only  in accordance with the approved motor data stated on the pump's plates.
- Thermal contacts must be connected to protection circuit intended for that purpose according to the approval of the product.

All electrical work shall be carried out under the supervision of an authorized electrician.

Local codes and regulations shall be complied with.

Check on the data plate which voltage supply is valid for your pump.

Check that the main voltage and frequency agree with the specifications on the pump data plate.

If the pump can be connected to different voltages, the connected voltage is specified by a yellow sticker.

Connect the motor cable to the starter equipment as illustrated in the wiring diagrams.

## Conductors that are not in use must be isolated.

The cable should be replaced if the outer sheath is damaged. Contact a Flygt service shop.

Make sure that the cable does not have any sharp bends and is not pinched.

Under no circumstances may the starter equipment be installed in the sump.

NOTE! For safety reasons, the earth conductor should be approx. 50 mm (2.0") longer than the phase conductors. If the motor cable is jerked loose by mistake, the earth conductor should be the last conductor to come loose from its terminal. This applies to both ends of the cable.

Thermal contacts are incorporated in the stator. The thermal contacts can be connected to max 250 V, breaking current max 4 A. Flygt recommends that they be connected to 24 V over separate fuses to protect the other automatic equipment.

NOTE! If the pump optionally is equipped with thermistors in the stator winding, make sure that the thermistors are never exposed to voltages higher than 2.5 V. If the voltage exceeds this value, e.g. when the control circuit is being checked, the thermistors will be destroyed.

Make sure that the pump is correctly earthed (grounded).

When using a variable-frequency-drive (VFD) the shielded cable (type NSSHÖU.../3E+St) should be used. Contact your Flygt representive and ask your VFD-supplier for electrical limitations.

<!-- PAGE 7 END -->

## ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

Remember that the starting current in direct on-line starting can be up to six times higher than the rated current. Make sure that the fuses or circuit breakers are of the proper rating.

The Parts List gives rated current. Fuse rating and cable shall be selected in accordance with local rules and regulations. Note that with long cables, the voltage drop in the cable must be taken into consideration, since the motor's rated voltage is the voltage that is measured at the terminal board in the pump.

The overload protection (motor protection breaker) for direct on-line starting shall be set to the motor rated current as given on the data plate.

Check the phase sequence in the mains with the phase sequence indicator.

If intermittent operation is prescribed (see Data Plate), the pump shall be provided with control equipment that provides such operation.

## Monitoring equipment

A plate in the junction box shows if the pump is equipped with sensors.

CLS-30 is a leakage sensor for sensing water in the oil housing and initiates an alarm when the oil contains 30% water. Oil change is recommended after the alarm. If the sensor initiates an alarm shortly after the oil is changed, contact your nearest Flygt representative. The CLS sensor is installed in the bearing housing and goes down into the oil housing. The sensor is not applicable to Ex-approved pumps.

<!-- image -->

CLS sensor body made of glass. Handle with care.

The FLS sensor consists of a small float switch for sensing water in the stator housing. Its design makes it suitable for pumps in vertical installations. The FLS sensor is installed in the bottom of the stator housing.

The two sensors, CLS and FLS, can be used in the same pump. They are connected in parallel. Follow the instructions for monitoring equipment.

The MiniCas II is a monitoring relay to which CLS and/or FLS are connected.

Check:

- -signals and tripping function.
- -that relays, lamps, fuses and connections are intact.

Replace defective equipment.

## TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE

The pump can be transported and stored in a vertical or horizontal position.

<!-- image -->

- Always lift the pump by its lifting handle - never by the motor cable or the hose.
- Make sure that the pump cannot roll or fall over and injure people or damage property.

The pump is frostproof as long as it is operating or is immersed in the liquid. If the pump is raised when the temperature is below freezing, the impeller may freeze.

A frozen impeller can be thawed by allowing the pump to stand immersed in the liquid for a short period before it is started. Never use a naked flame to thaw the pump.

For longer periods of storage, the pump must be protected against moisture and heat. The impeller should be rotated occasionally (for example every other month) to prevent the seals from sticking together.

After a long period of storage, the pump should be inspected before it is taken into operation. Pay special attention to the seals and the cable entry.

Follow the instructions under the heading 'Before starting'.

The pump shall be run for a short period after being raised in order to discharge all remaining water.

## OPERATION

<!-- image -->

## Before starting

<!-- image -->

- Before starting work on the pump, make sure that the pump is isolated from the power supply and  cannot be energized.
- Make sure that the pump cannot roll or fall over and injure people or damage property.

Check that the visible parts on the pump and installation are undamaged and in good condition.

Check the oil level in the oil housing.

Remove the fuses or open the circuit breaker and check that the impeller can be rotated freely.

Check that the monitoring equipment (if any) works.

Check the direction of rotation. The impeller shall rotate clockwise, as viewed from above. When started, the pump will jerk in the opposite direction to the direction in which the impeller rotates. See the figure.

In the case of dry installation, check the direction of rotation through the inlet elbow access cover.

Transpose two phase leads if the impeller rotates in the wrong direction (3 ~).

<!-- image -->

In some installations the pump surface and the surrounding liquid may be hot. Bear in mind the risk of burn injuries.

<!-- image -->

Watch out for the starting jerk, which can be powerful.

<!-- PAGE 12 END -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## CARE AND MAINTENANCE

Before starting work on the pump, make sure that the pump is isolated from the power supply and cannot be energized.

This applies to the control circuit as well.

## NOTE for Ex version

All work on the explosion-proof motor section must be performed by personnel authorized by Flygt.

Flygt disclaims all responsibility for work done by untrained, unauthorized personnel.

Make sure that the pump cannot roll or fall over and injure people or damage property.

The following points are important in connection with work on the pump:

- -Make sure that the pump has been thoroughly cleaned.
- -Beware of the risk of infection.
- -Follow local safety regulations.

The pump is designed for use in liquids which can be hazardous to health. In order to prevent injury to the eyes and skin, observe the following points when working on the pump:

- -Always wear goggles and rubber gloves.
- -Rinse the pump thoroughly with clean water before starting work.
- -Rinse the components in water after dismantling.
- -The oil housing may be under pressure. Hold a rag over the oil screw to prevent splatter.

Proceed as follows if hazardous chemicals have splashed into your eyes:

- -Rinse your eyes immediately in running water for 15 minutes. Hold your eyelids apart with your fingers.
- -Contact an eye specialist.

On your skin:

- -Remove contaminated clothes.
- -Wash your skin with soap and water.
- -Seek medical attention, if required.

## Inspection

Regular inspection and preventive maintenance ensure more reliable operation.

The pump should be inspected at least once a year, but more frequently under severe operating conditions.

Under normal operating conditions, the pump should have a major overhaul in a service shop at least every third year for permanent installation and every year for portable pumps. This requires special tools and should be done by an authorized service shop.

If the seals have been replaced an inspection of the oil is recommended after one week of operation.

NOTE! Regular check of the condition of the lifting handle and chain is important.

## Inspection of hot water applications

Pumps in hot water applications shall undergo inspection or overhaul at a service shop as follows, depending on the time they have been submerged in the hot water:

| Temp.           | Mode of operation   | Inspection     | Shop overhaul   |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| < _70°C (160°F) | Continuous          | 1000 hours     | 4000 hours      |
| < _70°C (160°F) | Intermittent        | twice a year   | once a year     |
| < _90°C (195°F) | Cont./Int.          | 6 times a year | twice a year    |

<!-- PAGE 13 END -->

## OIL CHANGE

A check of the condition of the oil can show whether there has been leakage. Note! Air/oil mixture can be confused with water/oil mixture.

Insert a tube (or hose) into the oil hole. Cover the top end of the tube and take up a little oil from the bottom.

Change the oil if it contains too much water, i.e. if it is heavily emulsified (cream-like), or if the oil housing contains free water. Check again one week after changing the oil.

<!-- image -->

The oil housing may be under pressure. Hold a rag over the oil screw to prevent splatter.

## 3126 / 3140 / 3152

1. Suspend the pump horizontally from an overhead crane.
2. Unscrew the oil housing screw marked 'oil out'. Emptying the oil must be done through the 'oil out' hole. Turn the pump so that the oil hole faces downwards. It is easier to drain the oil if the oil hole screw 'oil in' is also removed.

<!-- image -->

## 3170 / 3201 / 3300

1. Unscrew the oil housing screw marked 'oil out'. Emptying the oil must be done through the 'oil out' hole.
2. Pump out the oil. Using the oil drainage pump 83 95 42 or an equivalent pump. Make sure that the suction tube goes all the way down to the oil housing bottom.

<!-- image -->

## 3126 / 3140 / 3152 / 3170 / 3201 / 3300

3. Install the 'oil out' screw and fill with oil through the other hole. It is important that the oil be added through the hole marked 'oil in' since the oil housing must contain some air for pressure equalization. A paraffin oil with viscosity close to ISO VG15 (e.g. Mobile Whiterex 309) is recommended. The pump is delivered from the factory with this type of oil. In applications where poisonous properties are of less concern, a mineral oil with viscosity up to ISO VG32 can be used.

Please see Parts List for the correct volume and tightening torque.

4. Always replace the O-rings under the oil housing screws with new ones.
